#At any point while walking through a theme park,
#a person can either be:
# WALKING, WAITING, or RIDING

#WALKING: moving between two attractions
#WAITING: waiting in line for an attraction 
#RIDING: riding an attraction

#on a crowded day, it's likely that the greatest amount of time will be spent on waiting
